\ Time management
decimal

\ * Time keeping module.  Provides management of time, used to tag data.

\ The function set-time sets the time of an upcoming time-tone; the
\ function sync-time, corresponding to the time-tone, sets the actual
\ time.  The function prop-time, called at 1kHz, propagates time between
\ the time-tones.  If sync-time stops (i.e. time-tones stop), prop-time
\ continues to propagate the time.  Set-time and sync-time will stop and
\ start together; when sync-time starts, the most recently received time
\ from set-time will be old.  Therefore, the time received by set-time is
\ "aged", and an old time will not be used by sync-time.  Prop-time
\ performs the aging function.  (In ground test, it is also possible to
\ create scenarios where sync-time occurs but set-time does not, e.g. in
\ raw mode.  The design above also handles this case.)

\ * Two times are kept.  Appropximately once every two seconds, the S/C
\ * sends a new time that is to be used on the next synchronization pulse.
\ * The 48-bit spacecraft time is converted to a 32-bit integer time and
\ * 16-bit millisecond time.  Between sync pulses, the time is propogated
\ * by an internal fixed-rate interrupt (1000Hz).  This fixed rate
\ * interrupt is also used to generate ~1Hz signals for the command and
\ * timing processes; a second "1PPS" clock measures this timing.  The 1PPS
\ * clock is synchronized to the S/C clock with a constant offset generated
\ * by a phase-locked loop.  To achieve this, the interval from 1PPS to
\ * 1PPS will be varied.  To meet the requirements of the common code
\ * (specifically, for MAC_DELAY to work as expected), the get-time
\ * function returns the 1PPS time, which will remain static between 1PPS

\ The function set-time sets the time of an upcoming time-tone; the
\ function sync-time, corresponding to the time-tone, sets the actual
\ time.  The function prop-time, called at 1kHz, propagates time between
\ the time-tones.  If sync-time stops (i.e. time-tones stop), prop-time
\ continues to propagate the time.  Set-time and sync-time will stop and
\ start together; when sync-time starts, the most recently received time
\ from set-time will be old.  Therefore, the time received by set-time is
\ "aged", and an old time will not be used by sync-time.  Prop-time
\ performs the aging function.  (In ground test, it is also possible to
\ create scenarios where sync-time occurs but set-time does not, e.g. in
\ raw mode.  The design above also handles this case.)

\ * Two times are kept.  Appropximately once every two seconds, the S/C
\ * sends a new time that is to be used on the next synchronization pulse.
\ * The 48-bit spacecraft time is converted to a 32-bit integer time and
\ * 16-bit millisecond time.  Between sync pulses, the time is propogated
\ * by an internal fixed-rate interrupt (1000Hz).  This fixed rate
\ * interrupt is also used to generate ~1Hz signals for the command and
\ * timing processes; a second "1PPS" clock measures this timing.  The 1PPS
\ * clock is synchronized to the S/C clock with a constant offset generated
\ * by a phase-locked loop.  To achieve this, the interval from 1PPS to
\ * 1PPS will be varied.  To meet the requirements of the common code
\ * (specifically, for MAC_DELAY to work as expected), the get-time
\ * function returns the 1PPS time, which will remain static between 1PPS
\ * occurrences.
